So nice to see your face again
Tell me how long has it been
Since you've been here?
(Since you've been here)
You look so different than before
But still the person I adore, frozen with fear

I'm out of love but I'll take it from the past
I'll let out words 'cause I'm sure it'll never last

And I've been saving
These last words for one last miracle
But now I'm not sure
I can't save you if you don't let me
You just get me like I never been gotten before

Oh yeah, maybe it's the bitter wind
A chill from the Pacific rim
That brought you this way
(Brought you my way)
Do not make me think of him
The way he touch your fragile skin
That hunts me everyday

I'm out of love but I can't forget the past
I'm out of words but I'm sure it'll never last, ohh

And I've been saving
These last words for one last miracle
But now I'm not sure
And I can't save you if you don't let me
You just get me like I never been gotten before
Oh, like I never been gotten before

So nice to see your face again
But tell me will this ever end?
Don't disappear

I've been saving
These last words for one last miracle
But now I'm not sure
I can't save you if you don't let me
You just get me like I never been gotten before

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Like I never been gotten before
