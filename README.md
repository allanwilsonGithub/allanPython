# allanPython
This is a store for my scripts and projects while learning and improving my coding in Python

## FileSearcher
A tool to search specific files for given strings. At first just a log file checker to be run locally but would nice to give it a user interface (web?) and be able to run against remote machines (linux and windows)

###TODO
1. Returns line number and file name too
2. Searches multiple files from a list
3. Searches for all txt files / log files whatever on the system
4. User inputed variables
5. Runs on remote system (ssh ?)
6. Web interface with pretty output, maybe shows a 10 line snippet of the file?
